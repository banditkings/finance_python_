# finance_python_training
Additional ramp resources for members of an Intel Corp Finance DS Training Cohort to start applying what they learn to their roles

This library is NOT intended to teach python, pandas, data analysis, ML, or anything where there are thousands of resources. This will cover only tools/techniques that are relevant to FP&A, planning, and strategic finance roles. 

1. Methods applied in work scenarios (i.e., time series to forecast spending)
2. Examples of tools for productivity/time savings (i.e. how to get data from this kind of system)

Ideally, this should coincide with [watching seasoned colleagues work and working on real projects with expert guidance](https://hbr.org/2019/02/how-to-train-someone-to-translate-business-problems-into-analytics-questions)

And then aim for helping them **work on problems that the organization actually needs to solve**, and give them **opportunities to feel appreciated by the customers of their work.** (source: katie bauer @imightbemary great thread)
